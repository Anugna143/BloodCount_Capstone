# Blood Count

**Blood Count** is a Virtual Blood Bank web app, that aims at providing mechanism for people in need to directly talk to willing donors, and also find out blood availability in nearby blood banks. On this platform people willing to donate blood can sign up with details of their blood groups, location. Also thereâ€™ll be accounts of blood banks with details like number of packages of blood available and blood group, location of blood bank to filter out nearest blood banks.You can find the project's wireframe below which depicts the basic flow of our application.


## How to launch the app locally?

* Step1 -- Fork the project repo and clone it in your local directory. And run below command,

           
           cd BloodCount_Capstone
           


 **Note:** Make sure you run all your commands from inside cloned /BloodCount_Capstone folder, now and always.


* Step2 -- Downloading and Installation.

     Download and install _Node_ and _Expo_. (latest stable version) (npm comes along with node),

        [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)--(e.g v 8.11 )

        [What is npm?](https://www.npmjs.com/)

        [What is Expo]()       


* Step3 -- Install the npm modules from the package.json and required packages

           
           >>> npm install
           this command installs all the node related packages required to run the app locally in /node_modules
           folder. You can see this folder inside /BloodCount_Capstone folder after running npm install.

       //verify with below command and to know the version you installed
       >>>node -v

       >>>npm -v

       > Required packages:

           Go through [package.json](https://github.com/ravireddy07/BloodCount_Capstone/blob/master/package.json)
           


* Step4 -- Now, it's time launch the app, run below any of the commands.
       
	       
	       >>> npm start

              After this command, you'll see a barcode in cmd. Install the Expo app from Google Playstore. 
              Scan this barcode with the app, you'll see the output of the app. along with cmd's barcode, 
              a host will also be opened in your browser, from their also you can scan the barcode. 
              You can see the errors of your code as well on cmd or on host after running the above command.



Now you don't need to repeat above steps always to run the app rather its one time task.
But if you clone the project in new location then again you need to repeat step 4(only). Sometimes Step 3 for updating the packages to newer versions.
